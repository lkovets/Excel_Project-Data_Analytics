# 🔍 Excel_Project-Data_Analytics

This repository features my Excel-based data analytics projects, created to demonstrate how effectively Excel can be used for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing real-world datasets.

A huge thank you to [Luke Barousse](https://github.com/lukebarousse) and [Kelly Adams](https://github.com/kellyjadams) for developing the [Excel Data Analytics Course](https://youtu.be/pCJ15nGFgVg?si=eaVSlBZP-crDsYqO). This course has been an invaluable resource for building a strong foundation in Excel for aspiring data analysts.

The [dataset](/0_Resources/data_jobs_salary_all.xlsx) included here comes from the course materials and contains job titles, salaries, skills, and geographic locations pulled from real job postings in 2023.

Together, these projects highlight how **Excel** can transform raw information into meaningful insights through structured analysis and visualization!

# Salary Dashboard

[Salary Dashboard](https://github.com/lkovets/Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/main/Project_1-Dashboard/1_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx) makes it easy to explore salary patterns in data-focused jobs. By comparing roles, countries, and job schedule types, users can quickly see how compensation varies and use these insights to guide their career choices.

It reveals what employers look for and how mastering certain skills can lead to better-paying opportunities.
